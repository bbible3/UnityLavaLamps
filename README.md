# Unity Lava Lamps
Shader based, VRChat compatible Lava Lamps for Unity

This is an attempt to provide drag-and-drop, customisable Lava Lamp resources.
The effect is based on [@Luftprut](https://twitter.com/luftprut1)'s original Lava Lamp shader. It uses ray marching techniques to generate a quite realistic effect.
I have modified the shader to suit my needs better, including allowing globules to fall, offsets to be customised, and a user to input a seed so multiple distinct lava lamps can appear beside each other.
